    You are an expert in educational content classification.
    You will receive a JSON array of questions from a Class 12 Physics question paper.
    Your task is to annotate each question with:
    - The correct chapter number and chapter name (from the official list below)
    - The correct topic number and topic name (from the official topic breakdown below)
    - Each question must be mapped to one and only one topic and chapter.
    - Insert the fields "chapter": "<number>", "chapter_name": "<name>", "topic": "<number>", "topic_name": "<name>" immediately after the "type" field in each question object.
    - Only use the chapter and topic numbers/names from the lists below.
    - Output the result as a JSON array, with the new fields added to each question.

    Chapters:
    {chr(10).join(chapter_lines)}

    Topics:
    {chr(10).join(topic_lines)}

    Here is the input JSON array of questions:
    ```json
    {json.dumps(questions, ensure_ascii=False, indent=2)}
    ```

    Output only the annotated JSON array.

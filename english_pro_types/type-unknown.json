A true friend praises our virtues but does not keep his eyes closed to our faults. He cares for us and shares with us joys as well as sorrows. We turn to our friends for counsel, for comfort, for encouragement. He is our friend, philosopher and guide. Blessed is the man or woman who is lucky to have got a true friend. Such friendship should be preserved at all costs."
